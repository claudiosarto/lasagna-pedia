            <p class="history-paragraph">The concept of layered pasta dishes has ancient roots. Some believe that the Ancient Greeks had a dish similar to lasagna, while others trace it back to Ancient Rome, where they enjoyed a dish called "Laganum," which consisted of layers of pasta and sauce.</p>

            <p class="history-paragraph">The first recorded recipe for a dish resembling modern lasagna can be found in an English cookbook from the 14th century, where it is called "loseyn." However, it's important to note that at this time, pasta was not made with tomatoes, as tomatoes were not introduced to Europe until after the exploration of the Americas.</p>

            <p class="history-paragraph">Tomatoes are a key ingredient in modern lasagna, but they were not part of the original recipe. Tomatoes are native to the Americas and were brought to Europe by explorers in the 16th century. Initially, tomatoes were met with suspicion and were thought to be poisonous. It took some time for tomatoes to be widely accepted and incorporated into Italian cuisine</p>
